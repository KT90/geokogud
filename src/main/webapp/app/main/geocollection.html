		<h1>About geological collections in Estonia</h1>
			<p>Minerals, rocks and fossils that form the essence of
				geological collections are the main source of information of the 4.6
				billion year history of Earth. Unlike other natural history
				collections, the geological specimens represent both physical and
				organic world and common to all of them is the dimension of
				geological time.</p>
			<p>The largest geological collections in Estonia are nowadays
				deposited in three institutions, which also form the core of
				national geological collection: Institute of Geology at Tallinn
				University of Technology, Geological Museum of the University of
				Tartu and the Estonian Museum of Natural History. Additionally a
				great number of drill cores, actively used in international
				research, are held by the Geological Survey of Estonia. Various
				smaller collections are deposited in other institutions, local
				museums and private collectors. The oldest collections date to early
				19th century whilst the bulk of material has been accumulated in
				1950â€“1980s.</p>
			<p>In total more than 800 000 units are stored in the national
				geological collection, including fossil specimens, microfossil
				preparations, minerals, meteorites, rock and sediment samples and
				drill cores. The palaeontological collections are mostly composed of
				invertebrate fossils such as brachiopods, trilobites, bryozoans,
				corals, mollusks, echinoderms and graptolites, but also early fishes
				and agnathans. The microfossil collections are also notable, with
				chitinozoans, conodonts, ostracods and scolecodonts being especially
				well represented.</p>
			<p>In scientific perspective the particular strength of the
				collection lies in the Lower Palaeozoic palaeontology and petrology
				of the Baltic area, which serves as the proxy for the entire Baltica
				palaeocontinent. Estonian collections have contributed significantly
				to studies of evolution and diversification of biota during the
				Great Ordovician Biodiversification Event as well as the
				end-Ordovician extinction. The Estonian microfossil collections,
				some of the largest in the world for this time-span, have been used
				to establish and correlate regional and global geological timescales
				and biostratigraphical zonations.</p>
			<p>The drill cores and rock samples are continuously utilized for
				testing new methods and developing scientific ideas. For instance,
				the recent advancement in stable isotope research, which also
				grounds on collections, has turned the Baltic isotopic curve as
				world-wide standard for the Ordovician and Silurian. Noteworthy is
				also the Estonian meteorite collection holding several thousands of
				specimens many of which are unique in the world.</p>
			<p>When estimating the importance of collections for geological
				research in Estonia it should be mentioned that at least half of
				scientific papers published in international journals ground partly
				or entirely on collections. Likewise the national science prizes
				awarded to geologists during the last decade make intense use of
				collections and have not been possible without them.</p>
			<p>The first attempts to utilize electronic databases for
				collection data were made in 1994. However, it was only in 1998 when
				the Institute of Geology at Tallinn University of Technology started
				development of an in-house database specifically suitable for
				geological collections. As of 2008, this system has evolved into a
				complex information system that grounds on MySQL relational database
				back-end and MS Access-based user interface for data entry. The
				entire database is on-line and can be queried using public web-based
				interface. First in Estonia it joined the international
				specimen-level networks of BioCASE and GBIF. The data model of the
				system consists of more than 90 related tables, most important of
				which are the collection, specimen, sample, locality, drill core,
				agent, image, stratigraphy, reference etc. The same database is now
				used in all three main institutions possessing geological
				collections. In the Institute of Geology about 25% of specimen-level
				data are digitized and in the Estonian Museum of Natural History the
				amount of data is expected to reach 100% by the end of 2008. Next
				steps to make the data even more easily accessible include building
				a common public query interface and data portal for all data
				holders.</p>
